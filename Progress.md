# Striver's SDE Sheet
## DAY 1 (15 June 2022)
- [Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

**Hint**: Think about the use of data structures.

- [Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)

**Hint**: Try to find a pattern in all the rows/cols of pascal triangle.

- [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)

**Hint**: Try to find a pattern in all the different permutations.
**Dont's**: Never use the inbuilt function `is_permutation` of cpp.

- [Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

**Hint**: Question name says it all xD

- [Sort array of 0s, 1s and 2s](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

**Hint**: Try to build the solution from O(N^3) -> O(N^2) -> O(N).

- [Stock buy and sell](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

**Hint**: We want to minimise the current buy, and maximise our profit by selling at highs.


## DAY 2 (17 June 2022)
- [Rotate Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

**Hint**: Think about transpose

- [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

**Hint**: More of pattern based.

- [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

**Hint**: Think of merge sort (break, sort and merge basically).

- [Find duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

**Hint**: Try to use the algo tortoise one.

- [Repeat and Missing number](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/repeat-and-missing-number-array/)

**Hint**: Try to use some maths equeations.

- [Inversion of an array](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/count-inversions_615)

**Hint**: Hard IMO, O(N^2) is ez but to optimise will break head, think of sorting algos.
